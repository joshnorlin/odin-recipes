This is a basic recipe website. The website will include an index page with an introduction, and several links taking the user to other pages containing various recipes. Each recipe webpage will include a title, a picture of the meal, the ingredients, and steps to make the meal. Additionally, each recipe webpage will have a link taking the user back to the homepage.

This project will help me develop my basic HTML skills. I will gain experience with text-modifying elements such as paragraphs, bolding, and italicizing text. Also, I will become familiar with linking photos and webpages. Additionally, I will gain a better understanding of web security through protecting my website from tabnabbing and phising attacks.
