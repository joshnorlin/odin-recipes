This is a basic recipe website. The website will include an index page with an introduction, and several links taking the user to other pages containing various recipes. Work on this intro later.

This project will help me develop my basic HTML skills. I will gain experience with text-modifying elements such as paragraphs, bolding, and italicizing text. Also, I will become familiar with linking photos and webpages. Additionally, I will gain a better understanding of web security through protecting my website from tabnabbing and phising attacks.

Work on this intro, this is good practice.
